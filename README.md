### Overview

The aim of this project is to perform multi-class classification on MNIST Fashion dataset using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The neural network is build from scratch using _PyTorch_ library. PyTorch is an environment for programming neural networks with the encapsulated effect that you can use hardware accelerators, such as CUDA. It is built on top of TensorFlow which is used for distributed machine learning on any platform.

The Jupyter notebook in this repository consists of the code and comments for the project.
